# Assumptions
The main assumption for the estimation is that the developers have already set up an environment for mobile and web development. For example, to build mobile applications, you will need to install special software, and for debugging and testing, you will need the mobile devices themselves.

The estimate must also include the time required to deploy the final solution, professionally translate content, fine-tune SEO, and publish applications in app stores.

It is important to note that Terms and agreements were also formed generatively, focusing on the country's laws but without professional legal expertise.
